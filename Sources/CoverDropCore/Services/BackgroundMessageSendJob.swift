/// If less than `minDurationBetweenBackgroundRunsInSecs` had passed since the last run,
/// we will not send messages If there were any previous failures of the last run or more
/// than `minDurationBetweenBackgroundRunsInSecs` has passed we will attempt to send messages
/// If any of the message sends fail, we will store this fact, and retry on the next run regardless of the time passed
/// since last run.
/// Note that this is also triggered by the `BackgroundTaskService`

/// This is why we have the `skipBackgroundTaskChecks` to facilitate automated testing
/// To verify this works with background tasks enabled we need to
/// 1. Run the project on a device via xcode
/// 2. Put a breakpoint in `AppInitialView` after `.sheet(isPresented: $showCoverDropView) `
/// This will allow you to enter the debugger when you press the `Open Coverdrop` button
/// 3. Background the app to trigger the job scheduling
/// 4. Foreground the app and the app and press the `Open Coverdrop` button
/// 5. Enter the following code in the debugger. This will start a new task (note that this starts the previously
/// scheduled task from step 3:
/// `e -l objc -- (void)[[BGTaskScheduler sharedScheduler] \`
/// `_simulateLaunchForTaskWithIdentifier:@"com.theguardian.coverdrop.reference.refresh"]`
/// 6. Check the background task logs, you should see an succesful run
